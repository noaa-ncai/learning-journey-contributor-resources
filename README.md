# NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence Learning Journey Library Contributor Resources

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Center for Artificial Intelligence ([NCAI](https://www.noaa.gov/ai)) is building a clearinghouse of open-science resources centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for NOAA and the public that leverages standard development environments. Our goal is to provide a library to search, discover, and tailor accessible knowledge. From tutorials to best practices, we aspire to offer materials, training, and ideas.

## Contributing to the Learning Journey Library
This repository provides a set of resources to aid notebook developers in creating a contribution for the [NCAI Learning Journey Library](https://www.noaa.gov/ai/resources/learning-journey-library) and [Learning Journey Repository](https://github.com/noaa-ncai/learning-journey/). These resources aid developers along the process to create an effective Learning Journey for NCAI to promote as an example of AI in the NOAA mission space. The process for making a contribution is as follows: 

* __Stage 0 (Propose)__: Contact NCAI training team via email to discuss the potential Learning Journey idea to avoid potential duplication and discuss the timeline.
* __Stage 1 (Design)__: Plan an overall design for your Learning Journey.
* __Stage 2 (Implement)__: Follow the [NCAI Jupyter Notebook template](NCAI_Training_Notebook_template.ipynb) to implement your Learning Journey design.
* __Stage 3 (Review)__: Submit your Learning Journey to the NCAI training team via email with links to your materials (e.g., link to shared Google drive or your personal/organizational Git repo). The NCAI team will provide feedback on your submitted Learning Journey and iterate with you until finalized.
* __Stage 4 (Publish)__: NCAI will take your accepted Learning Journey and publish it through the public NCAI GitHub Learning Journey Repository.
* __Stage 5 (Maintain)__: NCAI training team will monitor the usage of contributed Learning Journeys and coordinate the maintenance of these materials with original authors and POCs of the Learning Journeys.

This repository mainly aims to address Stage 2 (Implement) of the contribution process.

## NCAI Notebook Template
NCAI developed the notebook template to facilitate community-contributed notebook development and curation as well as to provide a consistent feel for individuals engaging with the material. The template contains the following sections:
* __Overview__: Discuss broad topics covered in the notebook.
* __Tutorial__: Provide instructional content and hands-on activities related to the learning outcome of this notebook.
* __Exercise__: Include prompts that force the explorer to test whether they’ve grasped concepts in the notebook.
* __Next Steps__: Describe the next steps on the “Learning Journey” or follow-on / related materials.
* __Examples at NOAA__: Provide application examples across different NOAA mission areas.
* __Data Statement__: Describe the availability and accessibility of data used in the notebook. 
* __References__: Provide critical references that are cited in the notebook.

For contributors within NOAA, please reach out to the NCAI Training and Workforce Development team for specific details on making contributions to the NCAI Learning Journey Library.

## NCAI Notebook Development Resources

This repository also contains some notebooks written to aid NCAI Learning Journey contributors in addressing commonly asked questions and issues while designing and implementing notebooks that can work across a broad range of interactive computing environments. Note that these resources are for Jupyter notebooks and the Python programming language.
